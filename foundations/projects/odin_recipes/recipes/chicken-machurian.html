    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ tablespoons corn flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crushed fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crushed garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 serrano chile peppers, cut into 1/4-inch pieces, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ajinomoto®) (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons corn flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat egg in a large bowl. Mix all-purpose flour and 1 1/2 tablespoons corn flour into egg until batter is smooth; season with salt and pepper. Dip chicken into batter, working in batches, until coated; place on a plate in a single layer so the pieces do not touch.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add enough vegetable oil to reach about 1/2-inch depth. Fry battered chicken, working in batches, in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken, using a slotted spoon, to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in skillet over medium heat; cook and stir ginger and garlic until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cilantro and serrano peppers; reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>Mix chicken stock, soy sauce, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and monosodium glutamate into garlic-ginger mixture; cook and stir until sauce is heated through, about 5 minutes. Add green bell pepper to sauce and cook until slightly tender, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk water and 2 tablespoons corn flour together in a bowl until smooth; stir into sauce until incorporated. Bring sauce to a boil. Add chicken and stir to coat</li>  
    </ol>
